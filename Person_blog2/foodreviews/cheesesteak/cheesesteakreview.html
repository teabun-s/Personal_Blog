    <h1><a href=https://www.yelp.com/biz/boos-philly-cheesesteaks-koreatown-los-angeles-2>Boo's Philly Cheesesteak LA Koreatown </a> </h1>
    <p> Summary: Really good sandwich, but not perfect. I took this across the street to eat since there isn't any seating. By the time I ate it, maybe a couple minutes after receiving it; it was already soggy and hard to eat. I'm not sure if it was the bread or just because they kind of overdo it with the cheese wiz, but it made it not great to hold while eating. The flavor was great though. Maybe a little less wiz would have made it better in general as it did have that wiz sticky mouth effect. I'd go with another type of cheese in the future, but I was trying to keep it authentic to Philly. The fries were crispy and delicious. Overall pretty good option, but I'd revise my order in the future and see if the cheese switch solved some of the issues with the sandwich. </p>
